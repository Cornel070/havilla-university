                            <p>Havilla University was founded by Hon. Jones Ayuk Ojong Tangban, born on 30<sup>th</sup> of May, 1959, from Nturokim village of Akparabong community in Ikom Local Government of Cross River State, in continuation of his dream and passion for educational advancement in Nigeria. The university was approved in February 2021 by the Federal Government and given recognition by the National Universities Commission (NUC) to run both undergraduate and postgraduate academic programmes in phases. The university will commence academic activities in September, 2021 with two (2) faculties, eight (8) departments and eleven (11) undergraduate programmes.
                            A brain child of Steadyflow International Ltd (Steadyflow Group of Schools), Havilla University started fourteen (14) years ago as workâ€“in-progress. The project was mid-wifed by the Planning and Implementation Committee (PIC) and a Board of Trustees which serves as the conscience of the new private university, constituted by the Proprietor and CEO of Steadyflow International, Hon. Jones Ayuk Ojong Tangban and ably chaired by a renown Professor of Education, Prof. Florence Banku Obi the present Vice Chancellor of the University of Calabar, Cross River State, Nigeria. The planning and Implementation Committee (PIC) which has other eminent scholars as members worked round the clock to make Havilla University a reality today. 
                            <br>It has always been the dream of the founder, under the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, to develop human capital through quality education and training to produce visionary leaders that can efficiently face the challenges of the 21st century to drive economic growth and development as well as political stability in our nation and beyond. The founder also wants to give back to society through quality and affordable education.<br>As he fondly says: <q><em>It does not have to be expensive to be valuable.</em></q><br/><br/>
                            Havilla University is owned by Steadyflow International Ltd, an indigenous company in Nigeria, also founded by Hon. Jones Tangban. Steadyflow International Ltd owns and runs a group of schools, prominent among them are Steadyflow International Schools High School, Dutse Alhaji, FCT-Abuja, Steadyflow Nursery and Primary School, Dutse Alhaji, FCT-Abuja, and Steadyflow College of Education Akparabong, Ikom, Cross River State.
